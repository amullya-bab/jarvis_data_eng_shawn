This application allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations by using the JDBC API in JAVA. 
The JDBC API allows a connection between a Java basiced application and a PostgreSQL database by using DAO (Data Access Object) pattern. 
Over all this project gives an idea of Data Access Object, Data Transfer Object as an interface, and doing Database Transaction by using JDBC. 
Also, get ideas about the ACID terminology by handling SQL exceptions as well as using commits and rollbacks to perform the atomic transaction in JDBC.
